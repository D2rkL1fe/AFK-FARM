Priority:
	- place with all your pets ( e.g. farm )
	- additional tab with land to explore/to tame creatures
	- basic working UI ( everything in it )
	- saving and AFK systems
	- SFX and Music

Project Structure:
	1. Intro
		- splash/loading screen
	2. Main
		- loads straigth into farm with all your pets
		- pets are interactable
		- you can feed or train them
	2.1 Tutorial
		- if playing for the first time - loads tutorial
	3. Land expeditions
		- you can choose random land tile to explore
		- to explore you need to assign one of your pets there
		- it will take some time ( 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour etc. ) to reveal
		- expeditions work offline too ( AFK )
		- there you can find food or creatures
	4. Taming creatures
		- after finding the creature on the land you can literally talk to it
		- your goal is to convince it to join your 'army'
	5. Pet care
		- look up for your pet
		- pet it
		- feed it
		- train it ( AFK )
		- let it sleep ( AFK )

Limitations:
	1. Pets are the main cast
	2. AFK systems ( at least 3 )
	3. Use Player2 API
	
	PS: I can use any free asset to work as efficiently as possible

Main Idea:
	- Pets have AI in them and you need to tame them via negotiation
	- they may have different personalities and interests
	- so in other for them to join you, you have to convince them to

Mechanics:
	Exploring:
		- use your existing pets to research/explore new land
		- 1 pet at a time, uses it's energy
		- max 3 'expeditions' at once
	
	Taming:
		- you explore land where you can find animals/creatures
		- they have some AI in them and you need to tame them
		- ( basically negotiation )
		- you have a few attempts before it runs away
	
	Pet:
		- you can feed it
		- you can pet it
		- you can put it to sleep
		- you can train it
	
	AFK:
		- exploring can be done offline
		- pet training/sleeping can be done offline

UI:
	- Clash/Rush Royale like

	2. Land Exploration Tab:
